# How to Use Your Own USDZ Model

The site is currently using **demo models** from public sources so you can test immediately:
- **Desktop/Android**: Astronaut GLB model (from model-viewer.dev)
- **iPhone**: Toy Drummer USDZ model (from Apple's AR Quick Look gallery)

## To Use Your Own Bowl USDZ File:

### Option 1: Quick Method (Recommended)

1. **Add your USDZ file** to the `assets` folder
2. **Name it** `bowl.usdz`
3. **Edit `index.html` line 47-48:**

```html
<!-- CHANGE THIS: -->
src="https://modelviewer.dev/shared-assets/models/Astronaut.glb"
ios-src="https://developer.apple.com/augmented-reality/quick-look/models/drummertoy/toy_drummer_idle.usdz"

<!-- TO THIS: -->
src="assets/bowl.usdz"
ios-src="assets/bowl.usdz"
```

4. **Optional: If you have GLB version too:**
```html
src="assets/bowl.glb"
ios-src="assets/bowl.usdz"
```

### Option 2: Keep Both Demo and Your Model

Create a dropdown or button to switch between models using JavaScript.
